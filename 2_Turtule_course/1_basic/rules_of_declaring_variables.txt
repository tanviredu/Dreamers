Valid Characters:

Variable names can contain letters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), and the underscore (_).
They cannot start with a digit.
Case-Sensitivity:

Python is case-sensitive. For example, myVar and myvar are considered different variables.
Reserved Words:

You cannot use Python reserved words as variable names. Examples of reserved words include def ,True , is, False, elif,if, ,for, from, import, and, else, while, class, etc.
Underscore as the First Character:

While technically allowed, it's a convention to avoid using a leading underscore as the first character of a variable name (e.g., _myvar). This is often reserved for special cases in the language.
Underscores in Variable Names:

Using underscores to separate words in a variable name is a common convention in Python (e.g., my_variable), following the snake_case naming convention
